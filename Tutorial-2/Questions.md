Write Java Programs for the following:

1. Write a program which reads a no from the keyboard and check if its divisible by 5, 6. (All possible combinations should be handled.eg. it could be not div by 5 & 6, div by 5 but not 6, or vice versa, or div by 5 & 6)

2. Write a complete Java program that generates the first ‘n’ Fibonacci numbers, where ‘n’ is read as user input.
Eg : Enter n: 6
Output: 1 1 2 3 5 11

3. Write a complete Java program that reads an integer no from the user that computes the sum and prints the value.
Eg no : 12345, output = 15

4. Write a program that reads 3 edges of a triangle and determines if it’s a valid triangle or not. Also classify them as Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene triangle.

5. Write a complete Java program to compute the func(x) using the formula Both x (of type float) and m (of type int) are read as input from the keyboard, the result is to be displayed on the screen.

6. Write a program to read a list of integers from command line and print the no of positive, negative and zeros in the list.

    Eg countProg 10 20 -3 4 0 0 -2
    
    Output : positive nos = 3, negative nos = 2, zeros = 2

7. Write a complete Java program that read a series of numbers entered on the command line and displays the maximum, minimum and average of the nos. 

    Eg. MaxMinSum 1 4 0 -1 3
Output. Max = 4, Min = -1, Avg = 1.4
