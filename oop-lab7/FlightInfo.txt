Define a class FlightInfo which contains the flightNo, source, destination (all of type String) and cost (of
type float) and accessible only within the class FlightInfo).
Define another class FlightListInfo, which holds a member flist (of type ArrayList to hold a list of FlightInfo
objects).
Provide the class FlightListInfo, with member functions having the following signatures.
public FlightListInfo();//initialize the FlightInfo class
public void addFlightInfo(String fNo, String, String dest, float Cost); //adds the pair (fNo, dest ) to the
flightDestList
public ArrayList&lt;FlightInfo&gt; getFlightsSrcDest(String src, String dest); //returns a list of flightInfo from src to
dest.

Define the class FlightDestinationTester containing the main() method to test the usage of the FlightInfo class,
(inputs to be read from the user) as follows.

(Comp): Pl. enter the flight No , src, dest and cost (flight no =  to stop) :
(User): EK101 S1 D1 100

(Comp): Pl. enter the flight No , src, dest and cost (flight no =  to stop) :
(User): AK102 S2 D1 200

(Comp): Pl. enter the flight No , src, dest and cost (flight no =  to stop) :
(User): AB103 S1 D1 300

(Comp): Pl. enter the flight No , src, dest and cost (flight no =  to stop) :
(User): 

(Comp): Pl. enter the src, dest :
(User): S1 D1

(Comp): List of Flights from src = S1 to dest = D1 :
(1: EK101 S1 D1 100)
(2:AB103 S1 D1 300)
